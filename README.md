Tracking Consumer Sentiment in Smartphone Reviews: A Word Embedding Approach to Feature Extraction and Trend Analysis

# #
In this project, we analyzed over 27,000 smartphone reviews using advanced natural language processing techniques, specifically Word2Vec for word embeddings and TextBlob for sentiment analysis. The goal was to extract key features mentioned in reviews and identify sentiment trends over time, providing insights into consumer opinions and product performance.

# Project Overview #
Collected and preprocessed a large dataset of smartphone reviews.

Utilized Word2Vec to capture semantic relationships between words in the reviews.

Applied TextBlob to classify sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).

Conducted trend analysis to observe how consumer sentiment evolves.

Presented findings through visualizations and quantitative analysis.

# Objective #
To offer a comprehensive understanding of consumer sentiment and feature importance in smartphone reviews, aiding businesses and consumers in better decision-making.

# Technologies Used #
Python (Gensim for Word2Vec, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, pandas for data handling)

Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis documentation
